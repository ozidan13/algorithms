# Week 2: Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion

This week focuses on fundamental data structures and recursive problem-solving techniques. You'll learn about the differences between arrays and linked lists, implement your own linked list, and explore more advanced recursive strategies.

## Topics Covered

1. Arrays and Their Limitations
2. Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked)
3. Advanced Recursion Techniques
4. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
5. Memory Management in Data Structures

## Implementations 

- `array_operations.html` - Interactive visualization of array operations
  - Time Complexity: Various (O(1) for access, O(n) for insertion/deletion)
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Features: Visual comparison of operations, performance metrics, real-time manipulation

- `linked_list.html` - Implementation and visualization of linked lists
  - Time Complexity: O(1) for insertion/deletion at known positions, O(n) for search
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Features: Interactive node creation/deletion, pointer visualization, comparison with arrays

- `recursive_divide_conquer.html` - Examples of divide and conquer algorithms
  - Features: Merge sort visualization, recursive tree exploration, step-by-step execution
  - Time Complexity: O(n log n) for merge sort
  - Space Complexity: O(n) for merge sort

- `memory_visualization.html` - Visual representation of memory allocation
  - Features: Comparison of contiguous vs linked memory allocation, fragmentation demonstration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Explain the differences between arrays and linked lists and when to use each
2. Implement basic operations on linked lists (insertion, deletion, traversal)
3. Apply recursive thinking to solve divide and conquer problems
4. Analyze the time and space complexity of different data structures
5. Understand how memory is allocated for different data structures

## Exercises

1. Implement a doubly linked list with all basic operations
2. Create a function to detect a cycle in a linked list
3. Implement merge sort using recursion
4. Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively
5. Create a recursive solution for binary search
