# Week 1: Introduction to Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of the basic algorithms covered in Week 1 of the Grokking Algorithms study roadmap.

## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Algorithms
2. Binary Search
3. Big O Notation
4. Selection Sort
5. Recursion

## Implementations

- `binary_search.html` - Interactive demonstration of binary search algorithm
- `selection_sort.html` - Visual representation of selection sort algorithm
- `recursion_examples.html` - Examples of recursive functions
- `big_o_visualization.html` - Visualization of different time complexities

## How to Use

Open any HTML file in a web browser to see the algorithm in action. Each implementation includes:

- Visual representation of the algorithm
- Step-by-step explanation
- Interactive elements to help understand the concept
- Code snippets showing the implementation
