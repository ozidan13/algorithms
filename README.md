# Algorithms Learning Repository

This repository contains interactive visualizations and implementations of various algorithms based on the "Grokking Algorithms" book. It's organized as a 4-week learning roadmap to help you understand fundamental algorithms and data structures through visual, interactive examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four weeks, each focusing on different algorithm concepts:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to Algorithms
- **Week 2**: Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion (Coming Soon)
- **Week 3**: Quicksort, Hash Tables, and Graphs (Coming Soon)
- **Week 4**: Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and K-nearest neighbors (Coming Soon)

## Week 1: Introduction to Algorithms

The first week covers fundamental concepts in algorithms:

### Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Algorithms
2. Binary Search
3. Big O Notation
4. Selection Sort
5. Recursion

### Implementations

- `binary_search.html` - Interactive visualization of the binary search algorithm
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Features: Step-by-step visualization, interactive search, code explanation

- `selection_sort.html` - Visual representation of the selection sort algorithm
  - Time Complexity: O(n²)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Features: Animated sorting process, step tracking, code walkthrough

- `recursion_examples.html` - Interactive examples of recursive functions
  - Features: Factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, visualization of the call stack

- `big_o_visualization.html` - Graphical representation of different time complexities
  - Features: Interactive comparison of O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), and O(2ⁿ)

## Week 2: Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion (Coming Soon)

This section will cover:

- Hash tables and hash functions
- Breadth-first search
- Implementation of graphs

## Week 4: Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and K-nearest neighbors (Coming Soon)

This section will cover:

- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the week you're currently studying
3. Open any HTML file in a web browser to see the algorithm in action

Each implementation includes:

- Visual representation of the algorithm
- Step-by-step explanation
- Interactive elements to help understand the concept
- Code snippets showing the implementation
